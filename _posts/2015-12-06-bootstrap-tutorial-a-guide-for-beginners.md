**What you should know to make the most of this tutorial:**

**_Do you know HTML and CSS?_**

If the answer is yes, you are in the right place.

You should know how to identify HTML tags to create a webpage, and use CSS (Cascading Stylesheet) to make it pretty.

_**Do you know Javascript?**_

A beginner level is enough. The Bootstrap documentation is very helpful, with plugins configuration kept simple.

**_Do you know Bootstrap?_**

No knowledge of Bootstrap is required. This tutorial is a complete beginner’s guide to get you started with the responsive framework.

**What you will learn:**

  * How to download the Bootstrap files
  * The pre-defined CSS classes and HTML styled components
  * The fluid grid system
  * The JavaScript plugins
  * Mobile first and the responsive utilities
  * Leveraging and customizing the Bootstrap resources
  * And, a few bonuses!

So, let’s begin!

## <span id="Get_your_Bootstrap_Project_Started"><a id="1"></a>Get your Bootstrap Project Started</span>

### <span id="The_Project_Files"><a id="1_1"></a>The Project Files</span>

The project files are available for download as part of this tutorial.
  
The <a href="https://dujk9xa5fr1wz.cloudfront.net/extra_html/exercise/bootstrap-project.zip" target="_blank">bootstrap-project.zip</a> includes all the resources you need for you to follow along.
  
It is divided into chapters corresponding to each section of this tutorial, with a**before** and an **after**.

  * **before:** allows you to start from a specific section of the tutorial
  * **after:** includes the completed version of a section
  * Plus, a **final** folder is available if you want to skip ahead and take a sneak peek at the finished product.

We will also show you how to download the bootstrap materials as if you were starting a project from scratch.

### <span id="Downloading_the_Bootstrap_Files"><a id="1_2"></a>Downloading the Bootstrap Files</span>

First things first – you will head over to the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> page to download the Bootstrap resources.

Bootstrap offers three download options. Click the first button from the left to download the package, including the compiled CSS and Javascript files.
  
This is the most basic form of Bootstrap and the easiest way for you to get started.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146144" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image451.png" alt="image45" width="780" height="308" />](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image451.png)

(source: http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/_

Once you have downloaded, unzipped and saved everything in a convenient place, we can have a look at what’s inside:

### <span id="Bootstrap_Files_What_and_what_for"><a id="1_3"></a>Bootstrap Files: What and what for?</span>

**The CSS files**

  * bootstrap.css
  * bootstrap.min.css

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>bootstrap.css</strong> is the normal version. It can be used at the development stage.<strong>bootstrap.min.css</strong> is a minified version, less the spaces, tabs and comments. It is lighter, and therefore recommended for production when the site is ready for launch.
</p>

**Bootstrap-theme.css**

  * bootstrap-theme.css
  * bootstrap-theme.min.css

The Bootstrap theme is an optional and additional file. It comes also with predefined classes to add 3-D effects with gradients and shadows on some elements (e.g., buttons).

You also have the minified version when your site is ready for deployment.

**The JavaScript files:**

  * bootstrap.js
  * bootstrap-min.js

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You need to add <strong>bootstrap-min.js</strong> for plugins functionalities, such as <strong>modal.js</strong>,<strong>carousel.js</strong>, and <strong>scrollspy.js</strong>, that we’ll use in the project. It also comes in normal and minified versions.
</p>

**The Glyphicons**
  
Bootstrap includes a collection of over 250 <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons" target="_blank">glyphicons</a> in font format. These should be free.

Glyphicon example below:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146145" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image471.png" alt="image47" width="99" height="103" />](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image471.png)

You will see other files with the **.map** extension like this:

  * bootstrap.css.map
  * bootstrap-theme.css.map

You are now all set and ready to start your learning experience with Bootstrap!

We will kick off with the page layout.

Together, we want to build a one-page portfolio with:
  
An eye-catching banner
  
A portfolio gallery to showcase work **projects,** **services** and customer**testimonials**.

This should be a great way to get introduced to the Bootstrap library.

## <span id="Building_faster_with_the_Bootstrap_library"><a id="2"></a>Building faster with the Bootstrap library</span>

You need:

  * A code editor
  * A modern browser
  * The Bootstrap and project files

The library includes:

  * A powerful fluid grid system
  * A large collection of built-in CSS and components, ready to use out the box.
  * JavaScript plugins, easy to integrate with minimal configuration

The <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/" target="_blank">documentation</a> is organized into sections:

  * CSS
  * Components
  * And, JavaScript

Each page is divided into chapters with code snippets and examples that you can copy and plug right into your source code.

In the project, we will use:

  * The <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar" target="_blank">navbar</a> component
  * The <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#jumbotron" target="_blank">Jumbotron</a>
  * and, some <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type" target="_blank">typography</a> pre-defined classes

### <span id="Navbar_Quick_and_easy_setup"><a id="2_1"></a>Navbar: Quick and easy setup</span>

The <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar" target="_blank">navbar</a> provided by Bootstrap is available in different variations with lots of add-ons:

Search field
  
Collapsible menu
  
Brand image
  
Buttons and forms

And, there is more behind the scenes:

  * The navbar is responsive and its appearance adapts intelligently as the viewport width increases.
  * It requires JavaScript. The **javascript.min.js** file is usually added at the bottom of the HTML document right after the JQuery assets.
  
    It is absolutely necessary for functionalities like drop-downs and collapsible menus, to name a few.

I know what you’are thinking: it seems like a lot of work.

Well, Bootstrap has already done the hard work for you. We will not be building everything from the ground. We will show you how.
  
In your code editor, open **index.html**. You will only need this file open for a moment.

In your index.html file, you will see that we have already made some code available. We will change a few things.

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-146146" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image461.png" alt="image46" width="789" height="446" />](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image461.png)

A standard navigation bar is created with

{% highlight html %}
<nav class='navbar navbar-default></nav>
{% endhighlight %}

Let’s explain the markup bit by bit:

First, we have the `<nav>` element. If you are familiar with HTML5 semantic, you know that this is used to make your page accessible.

The `<nav>` element includes 2 classes: **.navbar** and **.navbar-default**

  * **navbar:** represents the main class, common to every navbar component.
  * **.navbar-default:** adds styling with a silver shade, and a combination of gradients and shadows.
  
    There is also **.navbar-inverse** to obtain an inverted navbar. Try to replace**.navbar-default** with **.navbar-inverse** to see the result.

We will move further down to find the `<ul>` element with the menu links: **home**,**services** and **projects**.

Now, we are going to start changing things:

**Navbar fixed to top**
  
It is easy to achieve with a pre-defined class:

  * Inside the <nav> element, add .navbar-fixed-top like so:

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-146148" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image491.png" alt="image49" width="792" height="122" />](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image491.png)

This will keep the navbar glued to the top. When you scroll down the page, the navbar stays in place.

Conversely, you can also use **.navbar-fixed-bottom** to have the navbar <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-fixed-bottom" target="_blank">fixed to the bottom</a>.

**Component alignment**
  
Now, the navbar would look better with the brand name on one side and the menu on the other side. The <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-component-alignment" target="_blank">component alignment</a> will do the job perfectly.

By default, an HTML element is aligned to the left. Adding the class .navbar-right allows you to float the element to the right.

  * Inside the parent element `<ul>`, add **.navbar-right**

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-146150" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image481.png" alt="image48" width="789" height="215" />](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image481.png)

Now, the menu is automatically flushed to the right.

**Brand image**
  
Next, we include a brand image to replace the brand name Joedoe.com.

  * Inside the anchor tag with the class **.brand-image**, replace the text link JohnDoe.com with an image tag `<img src=”..” alt=”…”>`

The image source is **images/bootstrap-logo.png**

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-146151" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image511.png" alt="image51" width="789" height="169" />

And there you have it: a nice navbar fixed to the top with the Bootstrap logo and the menu on the right.

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-146152" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image501.png" alt="image50" width="788" height="173" />](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image501.png)

Now, we move on to the banner.

### <span id="A_banner_to_impress"><a id="2_2"></a>A banner to impress</span>

The banner is a key element to make your content[<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <div id="toc_container" class="no_bullets">
    <p class="toc_title">
      Contents
    </p>

This is the most basic form of Bootstrap and the easiest way for you to get started.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146144" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image451.png" alt="image45" width="780" height="308" />](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image451.png)

(source: http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/_

Once you have downloaded, unzipped and saved everything in a convenient place, we can have a look at what’s inside:

### <span id="Bootstrap_Files_What_and_what_for"><a id="1_3"></a>Bootstrap Files: What and what for?</span>

**The CSS files**

  * bootstrap.css
  * bootstrap.min.css

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>bootstrap.css</strong> is the normal version. It can be used at the development stage.<strong>bootstrap.min.css</strong> is a minified version, less the spaces, tabs and comments. It is lighter, and therefore recommended for production when the site is ready for launch.
</p>

**Bootstrap-theme.css**

  * bootstrap-theme.css
  * bootstrap-theme.min.css

The Bootstrap theme is an optional and additional file. It comes also with predefined classes to add 3-D effects with gradients and shadows on some elements (e.g., buttons).

You also have the minified version when your site is ready for deployment.

**The JavaScript files:**

  * bootstrap.js
  * bootstrap-min.js

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You need to add <strong>bootstrap-min.js</strong> for plugins functionalities, such as <strong>modal.js</strong>,<strong>carousel.js</strong>, and <strong>scrollspy.js</strong>, that we’ll use in the project. It also comes in normal and minified versions.
</p>

**The Glyphicons**
  
Bootstrap includes a collection of over 250 <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons" target="_blank">glyphicons</a> in font format. These should be free.

Glyphicon example below:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146145" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image471.png" alt="image47" width="99" height="103" />](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image471.png)

You will see other files with the **.map** extension like this:

  * bootstrap.css.map
  * bootstrap-theme.css.map

You are now all set and ready to start your learning experience with Bootstrap!

We will kick off with the page layout.

Together, we want to build a one-page portfolio with:
  
An eye-catching banner
  
A portfolio gallery to showcase work **projects,** **services** and customer**testimonials**.

This should be a great way to get introduced to the Bootstrap library.

## <span id="Building_faster_with_the_Bootstrap_library"><a id="2"></a>Building faster with the Bootstrap library</span>

You need:

  * A code editor
  * A modern browser
  * The Bootstrap and project files

The library includes:

  * A powerful fluid grid system
  * A large collection of built-in CSS and components, ready to use out the box.
  * JavaScript plugins, easy to integrate with minimal configuration

The <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/" target="_blank">documentation</a> is organized into sections:

  * CSS
  * Components
  * And, JavaScript

Each page is divided into chapters with code snippets and examples that you can copy and plug right into your source code.

In the project, we will use:

  * The <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar" target="_blank">navbar</a> component
  * The <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#jumbotron" target="_blank">Jumbotron</a>
  * and, some <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type" target="_blank">typography</a> pre-defined classes

### <span id="Navbar_Quick_and_easy_setup"><a id="2_1"></a>Navbar: Quick and easy setup</span>

The <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar" target="_blank">navbar</a> provided by Bootstrap is available in different variations with lots of add-ons:

Search field
  
Collapsible menu
  
Brand image
  
Buttons and forms

And, there is more behind the scenes:

  * The navbar is responsive and its appearance adapts intelligently as the viewport width increases.
  * It requires JavaScript. The **javascript.min.js** file is usually added at the bottom of the HTML document right after the JQuery assets.
  
    It is absolutely necessary for functionalities like drop-downs and collapsible menus, to name a few.

I know what you’are thinking: it seems like a lot of work.

Well, Bootstrap has already done the hard work for you. We will not be building everything from the ground. We will show you how.
  
In your code editor, open **index.html**. You will only need this file open for a moment.

In your index.html file, you will see that we have already made some code available. We will change a few things.

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-146146" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image461.png" alt="image46" width="789" height="446" />](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image461.png)

A standard navigation bar is created with

`<nav class='navbar navbar-default></nav>`

Let’s explain the markup bit by bit:

First, we have the `<nav>` element. If you are familiar with HTML5 semantic, you know that this is used to make your page accessible.

The `<nav>` element includes 2 classes: **.navbar** and **.navbar-default**

  * **navbar:** represents the main class, common to every navbar component.
  * **.navbar-default:** adds styling with a silver shade, and a combination of gradients and shadows.
  
    There is also **.navbar-inverse** to obtain an inverted navbar. Try to replace**.navbar-default** with **.navbar-inverse** to see the result.

We will move further down to find the `<ul>` element with the menu links: **home**,**services** and **projects**.

Now, we are going to start changing things:

**Navbar fixed to top**
  
It is easy to achieve with a pre-defined class:

  * Inside the <nav> element, add .navbar-fixed-top like so:

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-146148" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image491.png" alt="image49" width="792" height="122" />](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image491.png)

This will keep the navbar glued to the top. When you scroll down the page, the navbar stays in place.

Conversely, you can also use **.navbar-fixed-bottom** to have the navbar <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-fixed-bottom" target="_blank">fixed to the bottom</a>.

**Component alignment**
  
Now, the navbar would look better with the brand name on one side and the menu on the other side. The <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-component-alignment" target="_blank">component alignment</a> will do the job perfectly.

By default, an HTML element is aligned to the left. Adding the class .navbar-right allows you to float the element to the right.

  * Inside the parent element `<ul>`, add **.navbar-right**

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-146150" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image481.png" alt="image48" width="789" height="215" />](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image481.png)

Now, the menu is automatically flushed to the right.

**Brand image**
  
Next, we include a brand image to replace the brand name Joedoe.com.

  * Inside the anchor tag with the class **.brand-image**, replace the text link JohnDoe.com with an image tag `<img src=”..” alt=”…”>`

The image source is **images/bootstrap-logo.png**

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-146151" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image511.png" alt="image51" width="789" height="169" />

And there you have it: a nice navbar fixed to the top with the Bootstrap logo and the menu on the right.

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-146152" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image501.png" alt="image50" width="788" height="173" />](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image501.png)

Now, we move on to the banner.

### <span id="A_banner_to_impress"><a id="2_2"></a>A banner to impress</span>

The banner is a key element to make your content](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image511.png) compelling and powerful. The jumbotron seems like the perfect choice for it.

**Jumbotron**
  
The jumbotron is a grey box with rounded corners. It will serve to call extra attention to the banner we are about to build.

As shown below:

  * copy the code snippet
  * add to your source code inside `<div id=”banner”>`

<div id="”banner”">
  <p>
    <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image531.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146153" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image531.png" alt="image53" width="789" height="459" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then, we make the following changes:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      A name wrapped in a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      A title wrapped in a <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-146155" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image521.png" alt="image52" width="791" height="249" />](https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image521.png)

<div id="”banner”">
  <p>
    To get this:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <img class="aligncenter wp-image-146154" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image561.png" alt="image56" width="790" height="288" />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Feel free to replace it with your own content, of course!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Buttons</strong><br /> A great call-to-action will make all the difference in your portfolio site. Why not use a fancy button?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Bootstrap <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons" target="_blank">buttons</a> have a common class <strong>.btn</strong> and another specific class to add styling and a color.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Example:
  </p>
  
  <pre class="lang:xhtml decode:true">&lt;a class="btn btn-default"&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
  
  <p>
    <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Color </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons-options" target="_blank">options</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> include:</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    .btn-default<br /> .btn-primary<br /> .btn-success<br /> .btn-primary<br /> -btn-info<br /> .btn-warning<br /> .btn-danger
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Inside the jumbotron, replace <strong>.btn-primary</strong> with <strong>.btn-warning</strong>, like so:
  </p>
  
  <pre class="lang:xhtml decode:true">&lt;a class="btn btn-warning"&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image541.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146156" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image541.png" alt="image54" width="788" height="244" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Next to <strong>.btn-warning</strong>, you have the class <strong>.btn-lg</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Size <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons-sizes" target="_blank">options</a> include:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      .<strong>btn-lg</strong> for a large button
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>.btn-sm</strong> for a small button
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>.btn-xs</strong> for very small
    </li>
    <li>
      and, no class defaults to a medium size.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    We keep <strong>.btn-lg</strong>, which will work best for a call-to-action.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Alignment classes</strong><br /> Finally, we center the text inside the jumbotron with the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-alignment" target="_blank">alignment classes</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the parent element of the jumbotron, add .text-center.
  </p>
  
  <pre class="lang:xhtml decode:true">&lt;div class="jumbotron text-center"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image551.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146157" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image551.png" alt="image55" width="790" height="127" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Final result:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image571.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146158" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image571.png" alt="image57" width="790" height="289" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The <strong>services</strong> and <strong>projects</strong> portfolios are coming next.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now is a great time to talk about the grid system.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    <span id="Webpage_layout_powered_by_the_grid_system"><a id="3"></a>Webpage layout powered by the grid system</span>
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    A portfolio is the place to showcase your most valuable work. So, you want to make it visible to a wide audience and on all devices.<br /> For that, we need a responsive and flexible layout that can work across all devices, from large screens to smartphones.<br /> You can achieve that with the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid" target="_blank">grid system</a> and the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-options" target="_blank">pre-defined grid classes</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The grid system is mobile first, fluid and responsive.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Responsive and fluid</strong>: it scales up to 12 columns as the device size increases
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mobile first</strong>: the design will always be full-width unless you specify otherwise with the pre-defined grid classes.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>
    <span id="Grid_System_How_it_works"><a id="3_1"></a>Grid System: How it works</span>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    The markup below is a basic example of the grid system:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image581.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146159" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image581.png" alt="image58" width="789" height="496" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    The <strong>.container</strong> represents the highest level of the grid system structure.<br /> Within the <strong>.container</strong>, we add the <strong>.row</strong>, which, as you may expect, creates a row.<br /> You can then complete the grid layout by adding columns.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The above grid example above, with 3 div elements and the class <strong>.col-md-4</strong>, will render like this:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image591.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146160" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image591.png" alt="image59" width="790" height="199" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Let’s break this down a bit:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>col</strong> is the common prefix to every pre-defined grid class.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>md</strong> is short for medium devices. It targets medium and large screens. (>992px). See other <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-options" target="_blank">grid options</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>4</strong> is the number of columns you want to add to your design.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    It can be a number between 1 and 12.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We will repeat this together, because now we have to build the sections: <strong>services</strong>and <strong>projects</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    <span id="Services_Section"><a id="3_2"></a>Services Section</span>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    In our template, inside the section <code>&lt;div id=”&lt;b>services&lt;/b>”&gt;</code>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Add a div .container
    </li>
    <li>
      Within the container, add the <strong>.row</strong> to include the columns.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The expected result is 3 paragraphs on 1 row.<br /> We are only targeting the desktop and large screens for the moment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So, we add 3 divs and <strong>.col-md-4</strong> like so:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image601.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146161" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image601.png" alt="image60" width="789" height="570" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Inside, add an <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      And, use <a href="http://lipsum.com/">lorem ipsum</a> for the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> content.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Let ‘s do the same for the projects portfolio section, where we will add images.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    3-3 Projects Portfolio
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Inside the section <code>&lt;div id=”&lt;b>projects&lt;/b>”&gt;</code>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Add a  <strong>.container</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Within the container, add a <strong>.row</strong> to include the columns.
    </li>
    <li>
      The expected result is 4 images on 1 row.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    We are only targeting the desktop and large screen for the moment. So, we add 4 divs and <strong>.col-md-3</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image61.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146162" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image61.png" alt="image61" width="789" height="560" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We will add images soon…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Image thumbnails</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We are getting closer to finalizing the projects gallery. We are just missing images.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Each column <strong>.col-md-3</strong> will hold an image thumbnail.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#thumbnails" target="_blank">thumbnail</a> is a component designed to showcase images. The markup is minimal and the setup quick – just what we are looking for!
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Copy the markup from the documentation below:
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image621.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146163" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image621.png" alt="image62" width="801" height="413" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Add the code snippet inside each column like so:
  </p>
  
  <pre class="lang:xhtml decode:true ">&lt;div class="col-md-3"&gt;

  &lt;a href="#" class="thumbnail"&gt;
     &lt;img src="images/projects/web-template.png" alt="image"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
  
  <p>
    This is a 4-column layout, so make sure to use <strong>.col-md-3</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      You can then add a source image for each thumbnail.<br /> We have made images available in the images folder (images/projects/web-template.png).
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Or, feel free to use your own assets. This is your portfolio, after all.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is how the final markup should look:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image631.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146164" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image631.png" alt="image63" width="817" height="671" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And, here you go!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image642.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146165" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image642.png" alt="image64" width="789" height="436" /></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now, add another row to display 4 more thumbnails
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In total, we have 2 rows and 8 image thumbnails.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We have another section dedicated to <strong>testimonials</strong>. This is empty for now. We will leave this part for later, when we will create a slideshow with <strong>carousel.js</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    <span id="Inside_the_footer"><a id="3_4"></a>Inside the footer</span>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    We will complete the design layout with the footer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We have 2 paragraphs and we want the 2 on the opposite sides of the screen. This can be done with a 2-column layout.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      We start with a <strong>.container</strong> inside the footer tags
    </li>
    <li>
      Next, we include a<strong> .row</strong> to wrap 2 columns
    </li>
    <li>
      Then, we add <strong>.col-md-6</strong> <code>&lt;div class=” &lt;b>col-md-6&lt;/b>”&gt;</code>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="”">
    <p>
      6 and 6 add up to 12 columns, which will be the full width of the 12-column grid.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Finally, we re-align each paragraph with<strong> .text-left</strong> and <strong>.text-right</strong> like so:
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image351.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146167" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image351.png" alt="image35" width="788" height="392" /></a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We are almost done with the footer. Next, we are adding a <strong>label</strong> and a <strong>glyphicon</strong>.

      <strong>Labels</strong><br /> The page was designed with Bootstrap v.3.3.5 and we want to highlight it with a<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#labels" target="_blank">label</a>. It works like the button with a <strong>common class .label</strong> and <strong>modifier class</strong> to add the styling and a color.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Wrap Bootstrap v.3.3.5 within <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the common class .label to the opening <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#labels">modifier class</a> to add color.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      We will add <strong>.label-primary</strong>
    </p>
    
    <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;span class="label label-primary"&gt;Bootstrap (v3.3.5)&lt;/span&gt;</pre>

      <strong>Glyphicons</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons" target="_blank">Glyphicons</a> are free to use with the Bootstrap resources.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Every glyph has a common class <strong>.glyphicon</strong>, then another class specific to the glyphicon selected.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We are going to use <strong>glyphicon-heart</strong> to display Designed with <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image102.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-146169 alignnone" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image102.png" alt="image10" width="12" height="11" /></a>
    </p>
    
    <ul class="c5 lst-kix_list_2-0">
      <li class="c8 c14 c12">
        <span class="c4">Inside the second </span><span class="c4 c2 c16"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code>,</span><span class="c4"> add a </span><code>&lt;span class="c4 c2 c16">&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span></code><span class="c4"> </span>

      <li class="c8 c14 c12">
        <span class="c4">Inside the </span><span class="c4 c2 c16"><code>&lt;span&gt;</code>,</span><span class="c4"> use the class </span><strong><span class="c4 c2 c16">.glyphicon</span></strong><span class="c4"><strong> </strong>and </span><strong><span class="c4 c2 c16">.glyphicon-heart</span></strong><span class="c4"><span class="c4"> like so:</span></span> <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;span class=" glyphicon glyphicon-heart" aria-hidden="true"&gt;</pre>

    </p>
    
    <p>
      The role of glyphicons is purely decorative, so to hide them from assistive devices (screen readers) we add the attribute <strong>aria-hidden=”true”</strong>

    <p>
      Good job!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Next, we’re going to take another step further into the Bootstrap learning experience with the JavaScript plugins.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      <span id="Javascript_plugins_made_easy"><a id="4"></a>Javascript plugins made easy!</span>
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Knowing some JavaScript will be enough to get you up and running with making your site interactive, and with the help of Bootstrap. Here’s how:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        We will start with <strong>carousel.js</strong> to create a slideshow and display customers’ testimonials
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, we will add a <strong>modal</strong>. This is like a small window popping up on a click event
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, <strong>scrollspy.js</strong>: another plugin that comes with the power of updating the active state of a menu link based on the scroll position of a webpage. (See the<a href="http://www.wndrmnt.com/" target="_blank">example</a> with scrollspy.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Even if it seems like a challenge, you can be assured that it’s not.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      <span id="Carouseljs"><a id="4_1"></a>Carousel.js</span>
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Below the projects gallery, we have included a testimonials section so visitors can read through reviews left by satisfied customers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Given the great amount of content possible, displaying 4 or 5 testimonials could use up a lot of real estate. Therefore, we will include a carousel to allow visitors to slide through testimonials one after another instead of scrolling down the page. Real smooth!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So, let’s build a slideshow of testimonials.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To build the slideshow, we will use:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel">Carousel.js</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#media">Media objects</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Testimonials Slideshow</strong>
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Copy the first markup <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel-examples" target="_blank">example</a> available on the documentation
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image391.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146172" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image391.png" alt="image39" width="806" height="653" /></a>
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Inside <code>&lt;div id=”&lt;b>testimonials”&lt;/b>&gt;</code>, add the carousel markup.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can get rid of the <b>indicators</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        We only keep the <b>wrapper for slides </b>and the <b>controls</b>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image402.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146173" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image402.png" alt="image40" width="789" height="561" /></a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Try it now!</strong><br /> You will see the structure of the carousel with 2 controls (left and right arrows) on each side. There is no content for now.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Next, we will add the content: the <strong>testimonials</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Media Object</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Inside each <strong>.item</strong> slide, we add a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#media" target="_blank">media object</a>.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Copy the code example available in the documentation and paste directly inside the <strong>.item</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image411.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146174" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image411.png" alt="image41" width="808" height="450" /></a>
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Get rid of the<code> &lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags of the <strong>.item</strong> slide
      </li>
      <li>
        And, replace them with the media object code snippet.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image421.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146175" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image421.png" alt="image42" width="789" height="290" /></a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To complete the markup of the media object, simply add:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        the image source: <strong>images/testimonials/…</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        lorem ipsum within the<strong> .media-body</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      To adjust the layout, wrap each media object in a column with <strong>.col-md-8</strong> and <strong>.col-md-offset-2</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This is the final markup below:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image431.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146176" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image431.png" alt="image43" width="1001" height="678" /></a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What about <strong>.col-md-offset</strong>? Well, we have not covered it yet.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-offsetting" target="_blank">Offsetting columns</a> works in combination with the grid system classes. It allows you to move columns to the right by increasing the left margin.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It works much like the grid classes.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        The prefix is to target the viewport size. col-<strong>md</strong>-offset
      </li>
      <li>
        The suffix number, between 1 and 11, indicates by how much you want to move the columns further to the right.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      See the difference for yourself with or without <strong>.col-md-offset-2</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Without, the columns are not centered.<br /> With, the 8 columns are centered and moved further right by 2 columns.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Image shapes</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We will finish with some images. Images can be styled easily with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#images-shapes" target="_blank">image shape</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Which one do you want?
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Img-rounded
      </li>
      <li>
        Img-circle
      </li>
      <li>
        Img-thumbnails
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Add .img-circle to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag like so:
    </p>
    
    <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;img class="media-object img-circle" src="images/testimonials/male-client2.png" alt="image"&gt;</pre>
    
    <p>
      We now repeat the process from the top to have 3 (or more) slides in total.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add an <strong>.item</strong> slide
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a <strong>.container</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Include a <strong>.row</strong> and 8 columns with <strong>.col-md-8</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        And, offset by 2 columns with <strong>.col-md-offset-2</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the media object markup.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, change the image shape with <strong>.img-circle</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      That’s it! Now visitors can enjoy cycling and reading through your clients’ testimonials. What a treat!
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      <span id="Pop-up_Modal"><a id="4_2"></a>Pop-up Modal</span>
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      The Modal plugin is like a dialog box or a pop up window used to display information to visitors.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We will add a modal to the jumbotron section. You remember – with the call-to-action button, right?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Clicking the button will make a window pop up to display… well, we won’t tell you right now.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image441.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146177" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image441.png" alt="image44" width="565" height="299" /></a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For now, we will show you how to create a modal via data-attributes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>2-step process</strong><br /> On the bootstrap documentation, let’s head over to the javascript section and select <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals" target="_blank">modal.js</a> to see how the markup looks:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We first need a <strong>trigger button</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>data-target</strong> and <strong>data- toggle</strong> are data-attributes that you embed inside your markup to bind the HTML elements with javascript.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    
    <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;a class="btn btn-warning btn-lg" href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#contactMe" href="#"Contact Me &lt;/a&gt;</pre>
    
    <p>
      In the jumbotron:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Inside the button element is where we add <strong>data-target=”#contactMe”</strong> and<strong>data-toggle=”modal”</strong>. This is the trigger button.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Change the text to <strong>“Contact Me!”</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class="btn btn-warning btn-lg" href="#" data-toggle="modal"  data-target="#contactMe" href="#" role="button"&gt; Contact Me &lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;</pre>
    
    <p>
      Next, there is the <strong>modal element</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It has 3 primary sections:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        A modal-header
      </li>
      <li>
        A modal-body
      </li>
      <li>
        A modal-footer
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      We have already made the modal element available in the project with our own markup.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In the source code, this modal structure is invisible until triggered with a click event.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        The modal element has a unique identifier id=”contactMe”.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image111.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146178" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image111.png" alt="image11" width="787" height="231" /></a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Very important:</strong> the data-target and the identifier must match. So, remember to update the <strong>data-target=”#contactMe”</strong> inside the trigger button, to match the<strong>id=”contactMe”</strong> in the modal.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Try it now!</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When you click on <strong>“Contact Me”</strong>, the button will fire off the modal dialog and display… surprise! A contact form:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image121.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146179" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image121.png" alt="image12" width="715" height="643" /></a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Inside the<strong> .modal-body</strong>, we have added a contact form. You can also include:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        A video
      </li>
      <li>
        An image
      </li>
      <li>
        Or, remote content
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      We will make a detour to the CSS section to explain how to set up a contact form.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Contact Form Modal</strong><br /> This is a great example of a pre-styled and enhanced HTML element. Form elements are ready to use with no extra styling required.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Here is how we did it:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms">form</a> documentation includes code examples and snippets that make the process straightforward.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        We have pasted the HTML form code snippet inside the <strong>.modal-body</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        And, we have kept just what we need:<br /> – fields for the name and an email address<br /> – and, a textarea for the message.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each label and input is wrapped in a<strong> .form-group</strong><br /> The <strong>for</strong> and <strong>id</strong> attributes must always match to allow autofocus.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Forms add-ons and variations include:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Static Control
      </li>
      <li>
        Focus, disabled and readonly State
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Help text</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>And, control sizing</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      We will look at the 2 last ones: <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-help-text" target="_blank">help text</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-control-sizes" target="_blank">control sizing</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-help-text" target="_blank">help text</a> is extra information to the user.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Below the textarea, we add the following code: <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;span id="helpBlock" class="help-block"&gt;250 characters maximum&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
        
        <p>
          &nbsp;</li> </ul> 
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image131.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146180" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image131.png" alt="image13" width="790" height="162" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            (optional) Add the attribute <strong>aria-describedby=”helpBlock”</strong> inside the associated input or textarea for assistive technologies such as screen readers.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-control-sizes" target="_blank">Control sizing</a> is made possible with super helpful classes like<strong> .input-lg</strong> and<strong>.input-sm</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Try <strong>.input-lg</strong> inside each input to see how it renders.
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
   &lt;label for="sender-name" class="control-label input-lg"&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;
   &lt;input type="text" class="form-control input-lg" id="sender-name"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
          
          <p>
            <strong>List-inline</strong><br /> Below the submit button, we have added an additional modal-footer to include a list of social media links.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> are, by default, block-level elements, meaning each will use one line.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In order to display the social media links on one single line, we use <strong>.list-inline</strong> like this:
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;ul class="list-inline"&gt;</pre>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image142.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146181" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image142.png" alt="image14" width="789" height="468" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This will result in an inline list like below, when the modal dialog opens up:
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image151.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146182" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image151.png" alt="image15" width="798" height="794" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Changing the modal size</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The modal comes in 2 sizes: large and small.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              In your markup, add the modifier<strong> .modal-lg</strong> next to <strong>.modal-dialog</strong>. This will make the modal bigger.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;div class="modal-dialog modal-lg" role="document"&gt;</pre>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image161.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146183" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image161.png" alt="image16" width="789" height="53" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Conversely, <strong>.modal-sm</strong> gives you a small modal.
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;div class="modal-dialog modal-sm" role="document"&gt;</pre>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Try it!</strong>
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            <span id="Scrollspy_navigation"><a id="4_3"></a>Scrollspy navigation</span>
          </h3>
          
          <p>
            The scrollspy plugin watches for position change on a webpage to automatically update the active state of the navigation links.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            It means literally what it’s called.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Spy = it <strong>spies</strong> on the element to which it is attached
            </li>
            <li>
              Scroll = it updates based on the <strong>scroll</strong> position
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            We will add the scrollspy behavior to the navigation bar. Just like the modal.js, it requires 2 steps:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              We add the data-attribute <b>data-spy=”scroll”</b> to the element we want to spy. We will add this one to the <code>&lt;b>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/b></code> element:
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;body data-spy="scroll"&gt;</pre>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Inside the body, add <b>data-target</b>:
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;body data-spy="scroll" data-target="#menu"&gt;</pre>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image171.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146184" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image171.png" alt="image17" width="794" height="81" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The data-target refers to the element we want to update with the active state. In this case, this is the menu navigation (<strong>home</strong>, <strong>services</strong> and <strong>projects</strong>). This one will have a unique identifier.
          </p>
          
          <div id="menu" class="collapse navbar-collapse">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Inside the div that wraps the unordered list <ul>, add a unique identifier.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <pre><code class="hljs xml">

</code></pre>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> both the <strong>data-target</strong> and the <strong>id</strong> must match.
          </p>

            <strong>Try it now!</strong><br /> When you click a menu link, the page skips to the targeted section and the link automatically updates to active. This is a much better user experience.

            Bootstrap can help achieve great results with little to no effort. Look at the portfolio that you just built. Impressive!
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Next, we will take your Bootstrap experience to the next level by teaching you how to combine default and custom styling.
          </p>
          
          <h2>
            <span id="Leveraging_Bootstrap"><a id="5"></a>Leveraging Bootstrap</span>
          </h2>
          
          <p>
            Looking at the source code of some websites, it is very common to find properties from Bootstrap. However, you could not guess by just looking at the interface. These sites look nothing like Bootstrap.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Many developers and designers use Bootstrap to get a quick start in their project. Their expertise allows them to fully take advantage of the framework while staying in control of their design.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            You can do it too!
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We will show you how to do that in a manner that is quick, effective and non-obstructive.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            <span id="Applying_custom_styles"><a id="5_1"></a>Applying custom styles</span>
          </h3>
          
          <p>
            In your code editor, open <strong>css/style.css</strong>. Inside, we have added some global styling.<br /> Below is where you will write your custom style to override the default Bootstrap CSS.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image191.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146186" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image191.png" alt="image19" width="464" height="248" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Very important</strong>: you never <strong>ever want</strong> to change the bootstrap files: bootstrap.css or bootstrap.js.<br /> This is recommended practice to keep your custom style and the Bootstrap files separate.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your custom style must be in style.css or else.
            </li>
            <li>
              And, the bootstrap files remain untouched.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Naturally, you must add your style.css stylesheet in the head section of the<strong>index.html</strong>, like we did for you.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image201.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146187" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image201.png" alt="image20" width="798" height="394" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The goal here is to override the default Bootstrap CSS. To do so, your custom style always comes last. This follows the rule of Cascading Stylesheets, so CSS rules positioned last take precedent.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            And, this is how we can start customizing Bootstrap.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            <span id="Customizing_the_navbar"><a id="5_2"></a>Customizing the navbar</span>
          </h3>
          
          <p>
            The default navbar is easily recognizable. Anyone could guess that your site is a product of Bootstrap. However, you want it to be your portfolio, not just a copy of a Bootstrap template. Time to be original!
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We will start by targeting the text links. They look a bit tiny.<br /> And, we will also change the font size.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In <strong>style.css</strong>, we have already added the corresponding selectors.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              First, we target the <strong>.navbar</strong> with <strong>font-size:20px;</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              Second, we make the width of the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> larger.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            (style.css)
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image001.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146188" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image001.png" alt="image00" width="460" height="271" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We also target <strong>.navbar-brand</strong> in case you should decide to keep a text link in lieu of the bootstrap logo.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Finally, we align the text links with <strong>.text-center</strong> in the HTML markup
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image012.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146189" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image012.png" alt="image01" width="662" height="149" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Looks different already.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            <span id="Styling_the_banner"><a id="5_3"></a>Styling the banner</span>
          </h3>
          
          <p>
            For the banner we want to get rid of the jumbotron’s default grey color and display the content on a plain background color. Finally, we increase the font size of the headings.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In order to figure out which CSS rule needs overriding, we must look into the default Bootstrap CSS. We don’t mean for you to open and inspect the bootstrap.css. No! Instead, we will use the <strong>inspector tool</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>The inspector tool</strong><br /> If you are using Chrome, the inspector tool comes with the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools">web developer tool</a>.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Click right on the element you want to inspect
            </li>
            <li>
              Select <strong>inspect element</strong> to open the console
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image023.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146191" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image023.png" alt="image02" width="788" height="329" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the console, the left side allows to inspect the DOM (Document Object Model)
            </li>
            <li>
              The right side provides you with styling details about the HTML element inspected (highlighted)
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Try it yourself! Highlight the jumbotron, <strong>click right</strong> and select <strong>inspect element</strong> to open the console.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image032.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146192" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image032.png" alt="image03" width="789" height="389" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            As seen on the console, the <strong>.jumbotron</strong> class has the following CSS rules.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We want to override: <strong>.jumbotron {background-color: #eee}</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image042.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146193" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image042.png" alt="image04" width="788" height="271" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            (console – right panel)
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In style.css, complete the code like so:
          </p>
          
          <pre><code class="hljs css">&lt;span class="hljs-class">.jumbotron&lt;/span> &lt;span class="hljs-rules">{ &lt;span class="hljs-rule">&lt;span class="hljs-attribute">background-color&lt;/span>:&lt;span class="hljs-value"> transparent&lt;/span>&lt;/span>; }&lt;/span></code></pre>
          
          <p>
            Once your custom change is applied, you notice that the information on the console has changed.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your custom style.css is available first, meaning that it takes precedence over other styles.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you scroll down the console a little, you will see that the same selector originating from the bootstrap.min.css is stricken through, meaning that it has been overridden by your custom style.
            </li>
          </ul>

            <strong>Font size</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            As part of the customization, we make the headings bigger with <strong>.font70</strong> and<strong>.font80</strong>.<br /> These rules are available at the top of style.css.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Complete the code like below:
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;h1 class='font80' &gt;John Doe&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;h2 class='font70'&gt;Developer &amp; Designer&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>
          
          <p>
            Same for the headings of the sections services, projects and testimonials:
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;h1 class="font60"&gt;Services&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 class="font60"&gt;Projects&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 class="font60"&gt;Testimonials&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
          
          <p>
            Finally, let’s change the color to something lighter.
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">.jumbotron {
   Background: transparent;
   color: #ecf0f1;
}</pre>
          
          <p>
            For the color swatches, we are using <a href="http://flatuicolors.com/" target="_blank">flatuicolors</a>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            And, the page customization is now complete.
          </p>

            We told you that it would be effective, non-obstructive and quick!
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Effective:</strong> the inspector tool helps find exactly which selector to target.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Non-obstructive:</strong> we allow the bootstrap and custom files to co-exist in a project without interfering with each other. The last file will override the first without altering the original files.Because your site is powered by the framework, you must always have the Bootstrap files in your project. However, removing the custom style will not break your site. You would only lose the custom style.
            </li>
            <li>
              And <strong>quick:</strong> because of the first two!
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>
            <span id="Mobile_First"><a id="6"></a>Mobile First</span>
          </h2>
          
          <p>
            There are over 3.1 billion mobile web users worldwide. In the U.S. alone, 25% of mobile web users use mobile only. And, the numbers keep growing.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Mobile first is an important concept to consider. As the web landscape becomes increasingly complex, it is becoming even more challenging for developers and designers to create the best universal web experience.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Thankfully, the Bootstrap framework is responsive, flexible and mobile first. It provides great tools and solutions to help build layouts that can gracefully adapt to any device.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Let’s see it in action with a quick demo.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Try to reduce the size of your browser and watch what happens.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            First, the navigation bar is replaced with a square-shaped icon with 3 lines across it.<br /> Clicking the icon will toggle the menu up and down to alternately reveal and hide the menu content.<br /> On a large screen, we see a horizontal menu that turns into a collapsed menu when switching to a small screen. Genius!
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image072.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146196" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image072.png" alt="image07" width="415" height="630" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This is a great example of adaptive design that Bootstrap can help us achieve with little effort.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            However, not everything looks as nice on a small device as on a desktop view.<br /> When you scroll down the page, you may notice a few areas that need improvement.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The pre-defined <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-options" target="_blank">grid options</a> classes and the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities" target="_blank">responsive utilities</a> will come to the rescue.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In this part, we are about to take it up a notch with more control over how your design renders on multiple devices.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Topics include:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Mobile first: How it works

              The viewport meta tag
            </li>
            <li>
              And, the media queries
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>
            <span id="Mobile_first_How_it_works"><a id="6_1"></a>Mobile first: How it works</span>
          </h3>
          
          <p>
            The <strong>services</strong> section is made of 3 columns. For that, we are using <strong>.col-md-4</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            You remember the third section’s introduction to the grid system, where we explained that <strong>md</strong> is short for medium.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>col-md</strong> is used to target medium-sized and large screens only.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any smaller size will not be targeted, bringing the column size to its default: full-width.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Confused? Let’s clarify with a demo:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reduce the size of the screen to see what happens with the <strong>services</strong> layout.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            With the grid system, the default styling is always full-width until overridden with a pre-defined class like <strong>.col-md-4</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image082.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146197" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image082.png" alt="image08" width="805" height="577" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Full-width looks best on a smaller screen – hence the concept of mobile first. So, we won’t change anything here.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            However, if you decide to override mobile first on a tablet, you would use the class<strong>.col-sm-4</strong> to target 768px-wide devices and larger.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Let’s try that next.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            <span id="Advanced_grid_system_Multi-column_layout"><a id="6_2"></a>Advanced grid system: Multi-column layout</span>
          </h3>
          
          <p>
            The <strong>projects</strong> gallery displays on 4 columns. That looks nice on desktops and large screens.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            What about on a tablet? It looks a bit squished. It would be nice to see 2 images on a row.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            With an advanced grid system, it is possible to combine multiple pre-defined grid classes to create a multi-column layout like the example below:
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3"&gt;
   …
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
          
          <p>
            The markup should look like this:
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image092.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146198" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image092.png" alt="image09" width="787" height="126" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            On tablet view, the class <strong>.col-sm-6</strong> will limit the number of images to 2 per row, while the number will remain at 4 on a desktop view with <strong>.col-md-3</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            See below if it makes more sense:
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Desktop view
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image251.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146199" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image251.png" alt="image25" width="790" height="418" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Tablet view – 2 images per row!
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image26.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146200" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image26.png" alt="image26" width="789" height="598" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Now, going even smaller, like on a smartphone, things start to get a bit cluttered. There is a lot going on. And, we have a lot to scroll down through before reaching the bottom.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To improve the mobile user experience, it is best to keep the content to a minimum and limit the number of images to 4 in total.<br /> How so? By making one row invisible. This is when the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities" target="_blank">responsive utilities</a> come into play.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            <span id="Responsive_utilities"><a id="6_3"></a>Responsive utilities</span>
          </h3>
          
          <p>
            Just like the grid options, responsive utilities allow more flexibility in the responsive layout. Their purpose is to make elements visible or invisible based on breakpoints.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In Responsive Web Design, breakpoints are used to target different devices with specific styling.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Hidden row</strong><br /> To make the second row disappear when we reach the small (<768px) breakpoint, we use <strong>.hidden-xs</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image271.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146201" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image271.png" alt="image27" width="790" height="185" /></a><br /> And that’s all there is to it!
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Testimonials: Adaptive content</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Moving on with the responsive utilities, we will adapt the testimonials section to the mobile screen.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            On a tablet view, the testimonials carousel looks fine.<br /> On a small device, it’s harder to read.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Inside the section testimonials:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              We add another <strong>.container</strong> right before the closing tag.<br /> <code>&lt;b>&lt;/section&gt;&lt;!—testimonial --&gt;&lt;/b></code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Inside the <strong>.container</strong>, we add:<br /> A <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code><br /> And, a media object (the same that we have inside the carousel) like so:
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image281.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146202" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image281.png" alt="image28" width="788" height="443" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Now, the goal is to make the content interchangeable and adaptive based on the viewport size.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>.visible-xs</strong> makes the content visible on small devices only
            </li>
            <li>
              Conversely, .<strong>hidden-xs</strong> hides the content on small devices
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            To do so:
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We add .hidden-xs to the container with the carousel
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;div class="container visible-xs"&gt;</pre>
          
          <p>
            And, we add .visible-xs to the second container without the carousel
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;div class="container hidden-xs"&gt;</pre>
          
          <p>
            Then, the web content adapts as the viewport changes size.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Now try it in your browser</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            On medium to large screens, we can slide through testimonials. Then, the slideshow gets replaced by static content when we reach the smaller breakpoint.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Interchangeable Headings</strong><br /> We are purposely making the heading bigger. However, this may not suit the mobile display. Too big!
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image291.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146203" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image291.png" alt="image29" width="392" height="643" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The idea is to duplicate headings in the markup and to alternately display them as the screen size decreases.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the banner, update the code like this: <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;h1 class='font80 hidden-xs'&gt;John Doe&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 class='font70 hidden-xs'&gt;Developer &amp; Designer&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            (Duplicate: will show on small screens only):
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;h1 class='visible-xs'&gt;John Doe&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 class='visible-xs'&gt;Developer &amp; Designer&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              The first headings will display on screens of 768px and larger
            </li>
            <li>
              The second set of headings (duplicate) will show on smaller screens with a regular font size: 36px.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Repeat the process for each section:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Services
            </li>
            <li>
              Projects
            </li>
            <li>
              Testimonials
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Example:
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;h1 class='font60 hidden-xs'&gt;Services&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 class='visible-xs'&gt;Services&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
          
          <p>
            Now, you are probably wondering how the browser can figure out which class to apply. This is when the meta viewport tag comes into play.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            <span id="The_Viewport_Meta_Tag"><a id="6_4"></a>The Viewport Meta Tag</span>
          </h3>
          
          <p>
            The meta viewport is set in the head section of the <strong>index.html</strong>
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</pre>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image301.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146204" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image301.png" alt="image30" width="792" height="89" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The viewport represents the visible area of a page, which varies as the device size gets smaller or larger.<br /> With the viewport meta tag, the width of the screen is detected and the information is sent to the browser, which knows the CSS to apply for a specific breakpoint. It lets you control how you want your site to display on different screen sizes.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            For better control over cross-platform responsive design, you can write styling that will take effect for specific breakpoints. CSS lets you define it with the <strong>media queries</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            <span id="Media_Queries"><a id="6_5"></a>Media Queries</span>
          </h3>
          
          <p>
            The <strong>@media</strong> rule is used to define different styling for key breakpoints.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Some global styling was not really to our liking.<br /> So, in style.css, we use the @media rule to write custom styling for the navigation links and the footer to better fit the small screen view.
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">@media screen and (max-width: 468px) {
}</pre>
          
          <p>
            <b>Navigation links </b><b><li></b>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Because full-width always works best on small screens, we set the width of the<b><li></b> at 100%
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the media queries, update with the code below: <pre class="lang:default decode:true">@media screen and (max-width: 468px) {

.navbar li {
     width: 100%;
}

}</pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Footer</strong><br /> For the footer, the columns become full-width automatically with mobile first.<br /> However, we use text alignment classes in the markup and it looks funny on a small screen.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So, we adjust like so:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              text-align:left
            </li>
            <li>
              Plus, we are adding a little bit of margin on the top and bottom.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            In the media queries, update with the code below:
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">footer p {
   text-align: left;
   margin: 3px 0;
}</pre>
          
          <p>
            Before After – Better!

Replace the @variables with numerical values to define your breakpoints and you are good to go.

            There is more to come, and we have saved the best for last. Here come the bonuses!

            <span id="BONUSES"><a id="7"></a>BONUSES</span>
          </h2>
          
          <p>
            Topics include:
          </p>
          
          <ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Tooltip.js</strong><br /> Tooltip.js is a quick way to display extended information on mouseover, like the example below when hovering over an image.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image332.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146207" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image332.png" alt="image33" width="304" height="266" /></a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            It works via data-attributes, and the configuration is minimal.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Inside <code>&lt;div id=”project”&gt;</code>, each image thumbnail will include a tooltip:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              First, the attributes: <b>data-toggle</b> and <b>data-placement</b> are added to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>element.
            </li>
            <li>
              Another attribute is <b>title</b> with the text you want to display as a value. <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;img data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Add text"  src="images/projects/web-template6.png" alt='image'&gt;</pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            You will not be able to see the tooltip yet.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Tooltip.js needs to be <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips-usage">initialized</a> with a little script at the bottom of the index.html like so:
          </p>
          
          <pre class="lang:default decode:true">$(function () {
    $('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip()
});</pre>
          
          <p>
            We call tooltip() on [data-toggle=”<b>tooltip</b>“]
          </p>
          
          <div id="”project”">
            <p>
              <strong>Try it!</strong> You must refresh your browser first.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                Update data-placement to position the tooltip: left, right or top
              </li>
              <li>
                Update title to add your text
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              <strong>More Carousel.js options</strong><br /> We want to show you how to have more control over the carousel behavior, such as:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                Interval
              </li>
              <li>
                And, pause on hover
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              The <strong>interval</strong> is the amount of time between each slide. The default is 5000ms, which is in milliseconds.<br /> To give your visitors all the time they need to read through testimonials, we should increase this value a bit.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel-options" target="_blank">Options</a> can be easily implemented via data-attributes, inside the carousel parent element, along with other data-attributes like this:
            </p>
            
            <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;div id="carousel-example-generic" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel"&gt;</pre>
            
            <p>
              To change the default value of interval, we write data-interval<br /> The value is in milliseconds. So, we write 10000 for a 10-second interval.
            </p>
            
            <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;div id="carousel-example-generic" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel" data-interval="10000" &gt;</pre>
            
            <p>
              That’s more time to read all the great feedback left by customers!
            </p>
            
            <p>
              You also can allow a <strong>pause</strong> between each slide.<br /> On mouseover, the cycling pauses automatically, and then it resumes on mouseout.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This is another option available with <strong>data-pause=”hover”</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Add it to the carousel parent element like so:
            </p>
            
            <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;div id="carousel-example-generic" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel" data-interval="10000" data-pause="hover"&gt;</pre>
            
            <p>
              Now, try it!<br /> The slideshow cycles through the slides every 10 seconds, stops on hover and resumes on mouseleave.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              It is definite advantage to be able to control the behavior of a site this way. You can read more about <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel-options" target="_blank">options here</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Font Awesome</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> is a collection of 519 scalable vector icons, also designed by the Bootstrap team. They are delivered in font format, so they can be customized with CSS.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We will update the following sections with the Font Awesome icons.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                Services
              </li>
              <li>
                Modal Contact Form
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              We will start with a quick setup with CDN.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Quick setup with CDN</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Font Awesome offers a quick and handy way to <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/http:/fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/" target="_blank">get started</a> with the CDN.<br /> In the head section, we have added the Font Awesome CDN.<br /> <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image34.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-146209" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image34.png" alt="image34" width="787" height="247" /></a>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              A<strong> CDN</strong> is a <strong>Content Delivery Network</strong>, or a system of distributed servers that delivers content based on the user’s geographical location.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This is like using a regular stylesheet, except that the file is hosted on an external server. Therefore, the page is lighter and loads much faster.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Now, we are going to see <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/" target="_blank">examples</a> of icons and see how to add them to our designs.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                To add a Font Awesome icon, use <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tags
              </li>
              <li>
                The common class is <strong>.fa</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                Then, add a modifier for the icon selected. Example: <strong>.fa-camera-retro</strong>
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              Here is the result:
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image24.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146210" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image24.png" alt="image24" width="64" height="54" /></a>
            </p>
            
            <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;i class="fa fa-camera"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</pre>
            
            <p>
              In the services sections, we add a few icons to make it more appealing.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                In the markup, add a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> above the <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> will host the icons wrapped in <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
              Complete the markup like so:

            <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-mobile"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
            
            <p>
              You can also customize the size with .fa-4x
            </p>
            
            <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-mobile fa-4x"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
            
            <p>
              Update all 3 columns with Font Awesome <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/" target="_blank">icons</a> like this:
            </p>
            
            <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-desktop fa-4x"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-mobile fa-4x"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-pencil fa-4x"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
            
            <p>
              Font Awesome is in font format, so we can customize with the CSS color property in style.css:
            </p>
            
            <pre class="lang:default decode:true">#services i {
color: #3498db;
}</pre>
            
            <p>
              We do the same for the contact form in the modal dialog. In the modal footer, we have included text links that we will replace with font icons.<br /> From this:
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image221.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146212" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image221.png" alt="image22" width="640" height="174" /></a>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              To this:
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image23.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146213" src="https://blog.udemy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image23.png" alt="image23" width="650" height="188" /></a>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In the modal element, we replace the text links with social media font icons.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The markup looks like this:
            </p>
            
            <pre class="lang:default decode:true">&lt;ul class="list-inline"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-facebook-square fa-3x"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-twitter fa-3x"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-linkedin fa-3x"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-github fa-3x"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Background Image</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This is the final touch to wrap it all up.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In the project files, we have added background images <strong>images/background.</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In style.css, we can update like so:
            </p>
            
            <pre class="lang:default decode:true">#banner {
    background: url("../images/background/bg-1.jpg");
   	background-size: cover;
}</pre>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Try it!</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
